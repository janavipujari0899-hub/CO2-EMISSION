# CO₂ Emissions Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Co2.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to analyze and predict CO₂ emissions using Python and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook performs data analysis and builds regression models to predict CO₂ values based on the given dataset (`co2.csv`). It focuses on:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Polynomial Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Saving the trained model

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Joblib

## 📂 Files in the Project

* `Co2.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the complete code and analysis
* `co2.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the model
* `README.md` – Project documentation

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to measure prediction accuracy. Polynomial features and Lasso regression are used to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

## 💾 Model Saving

The trained model is saved using `joblib` so it can be reused without retraining.

## ✨ Conclusion

This project shows a simple and clear approach to CO₂ emission prediction using regression techniques. It is suitable for beginners learning data science and machine learning.
